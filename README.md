`Tree.sh` is a terminal animation based on the classic [Acme::POE::Tree](https://github.com/rcaputo/acme-poe-tree) by Rocco Caputo but it's written in Bash from scratch to be more portable, easier to install and simpler (200 SLOC less).

## Run without installation
	wget -O - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/edkalrio/Tree.sh/Tree.sh | bash

Yep; That's all. Compare with the [original](https://www.cyberciti.biz/open-source/command-line-hacks/linux-unix-desktop-fun-christmas-tree-for-your-terminal/).
